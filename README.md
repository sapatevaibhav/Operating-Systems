Operating System Practical Question Bank
---

1.Implementation of Basic Linux Commands: echo, ls, read, cat, touch, test, loops, arithmetic
comparison, conditional loops, grep, sed etc.

---

2.<a href="/address_book.sh">
 Shell programming: Write a program to implement an address book with the options given below:
a) Create an address book. b) View the address book. c) Insert a record. d) Delete a record. e)
Modify a record. f) Exit.</a>

---

3.<a href="/sstf.c"> Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SSTF considering the initial head
position moving away from the spindle.</a>

---

4.<a href="/sstf.c">Implement the C program in which the main program accepts the integers to be sorted. The main
program uses the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. The parent
process sorts the integers using a sorting algorithm and waits for the child process using the
WAIT system call to sort the integers using any sorting algorithm. Also, demonstrate zombie and
orphan states.</a>

---

5.<a href="/sstf.c">Implement the C program in which the main program accepts an array. The main program uses
the FORK system call to create a new process called a child process. The parent process sorts an
array and passes the sorted array to the child process through the command line arguments of
the EXECVE system call. The child process uses an EXECVE system call to load a new program
that displays the array in reverse order.</a>

---

6.<a href="/sstf.c">Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: FCFS, LRU, and Optimal for frame
size as minimum of three.</a>

---

7.<a href="/sstf.c">Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Shortest Job First (Preemptive) and
Round Robin with different arrival time.</a>

---

8.<a href="/sstf.c">Thread synchronization using counting semaphores. Application to demonstrate: producer-
consumer problem with counting semaphores and mutex.</a>

---

9.<a href="/sstf.c">Thread synchronization and mutual exclusion using mutex. Application to demonstrate: Reader-
Writer problem with reader priority.</a>

---

10.<a href="/sstf.c">Implement the C program for Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm: Bankers Algorithm.</a>

---

12.<a href="/sstf.c">Inter-process communication in Linux using Pipes:
FIFOS: Full duplex communication between two independent processes. The first process accepts
sentences and writes on one pipe to be read by the second process and the second process counts
the number of characters, the number of words, and the number of lines in accepted sentences,
and writes this output in a text file and writes the contents of the file on the second pipe to be
read by the first process and displays on standard output.</a>

---

13.<a href="/sstf.c">Inter-process Communication in Linux using Shared Memory:
Application to demonstrate: Client and Server Programs in which the server process creates a
shared memory segment and writes the message to the shared memory segment. The client
process reads the message from the shared memory segment and displays it on the screen. </a>
